* This repository should store all important codes I must not lose. I've already experienced two traumas, losing all the codes by accident before, so I do not want to repeat the same trajedy again. All codes should be well organized. 

Here is a structure of my personal website. I am going to present it in the shape of the tree. 
"|" refers to the same hierarchy, "->" indicates the lower hierarcky. 

I am sorry for the poor representation, it is unfortunate that this README page does not allow me to draw the path-directory tree. 


src
 -> Blogpages -> myFirstBlog.js, mySecondBlog.js | components -> Blog.js, Home.js, RandomRambling.js | images -> black_image.jpg, Homepage.jpg, Sun-image.jpg | style-components
 -> Blog.css, Home.css, Rambling.css | App.css | App.js | index.css | index.js

... rest of the files ... 

Navigation relationship is quite complex between js files.

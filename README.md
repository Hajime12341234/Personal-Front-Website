This repository should store all important codes I must not lose. I've already experienced two traumas before, so I do not want to repeat the trajedy. 
All codes should be well organized. 

Here is a structure of my personal website. I am going to present it in the shape of the tree. 

src
 -> Blogpages
     -> myFirstBlog.js
     -> mySecondBlog.js
 -> components
     -> Blog.js
     -> Home.js
     -> RandomRambling.js
 -> images
     -> black_image.jpg
     -> Homepage.jpg
     -> Sun-image.jpg
 -> style-components
     -> Blog.css
     -> Home.css
     -> Rambling.css
App.css
App.js
index.css
index.js

... rest of the files ... 

Navigation relationship is quite complex between js files.
